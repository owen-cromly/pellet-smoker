## Part 2.4
I noticed that when discussing equilibrium points, we are setting `x_dot=[0,0,0]`. This is not really that valuable, and we should be more interested in cases where `x=[0,0,m] for some arbitrary rate.

It is not a good thing that Tf and Tc are = Tamb in this case. In this case, nothing is fed into the smoker and the temperature settles to ambient.
